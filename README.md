Welcome to OWASP =S.T.I.N.G=
=====

You will need a current Grails installation (2.2.4) to run the application.

The OWASP =S.T.I.N.G= is a tool used for creating project specific security/privacy requirement catalogues by selecting from a huge set of potential requirements, policies or best practices. It acts as a kind of questionnaire and will generate a list of requirements and/or policies which are relevant for the project's context.
